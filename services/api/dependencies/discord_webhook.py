    Validate Discord webhook Ed25519 signature.

    Discord signs webhook payloads using Ed25519 cryptography. This dependency
    validates the signature before allowing the webhook to be processed.

    Signature verification process:
    1. Concatenate timestamp string + raw body bytes
    2. Verify signature against this message using public key
    3. Return validated body if signature is valid

    Args:
        request: FastAPI request object containing webhook payload
        x_signature_ed25519: Discord signature from X-Signature-Ed25519 header
        x_signature_timestamp: Discord timestamp from X-Signature-Timestamp header

    Returns:
        Validated request body as bytes

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 500 if DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY is not configured
        HTTPException: 401 if signature validation fails
