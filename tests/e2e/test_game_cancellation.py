"""End-to-end tests for game cancellation Discord message handling.

Tests the complete flow:
1. POST /games → Bot posts announcement to Discord channel
2. DELETE /games/{game_id} → Bot handles GAME_CANCELLED event
3. Verification that Discord message updated to show cancelled status

Requires:
- PostgreSQL with migrations applied and E2E data seeded by init service
- RabbitMQ with exchanges/queues configured
- Discord bot connected to test guild
- API service running on localhost:8000
- Full stack via compose.e2e.yaml profile

E2E data seeded by init service:
- Test guild configuration (from DISCORD_GUILD_ID)
- Test channel configuration (from DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID)
- Test host user (from DISCORD_USER_ID)
