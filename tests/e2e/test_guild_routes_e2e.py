"""
E2E tests for guild routes using require_guild_by_id.

Tests verify that migrated guild routes enforce authorization:
- Users can access guilds they belong to
- Users get 404 for guilds they don't belong to (cross-guild isolation)
- Non-existent guilds return 404

These tests verify the authorization enforcement in require_guild_by_id,
which provides defense-in-depth before full RLS is enabled.
