"""End-to-end tests for game status transitions and Discord message updates.

Tests the complete flow:
1. POST /games scheduled 1 minute in future with 2 minute duration
2. Status transition daemon processes SCHEDULED→IN_PROGRESS transition
3. Verify game status updated in database
4. Verify Discord message refreshed with IN_PROGRESS status
5. Status transition daemon processes IN_PROGRESS→COMPLETED transition
6. Verify game status updated to COMPLETED
7. Verify Discord message refreshed with COMPLETED status

Requires:
- PostgreSQL with migrations applied and E2E data seeded by init service
- RabbitMQ with exchanges/queues configured
- Discord bot connected to test guild
- Status transition daemon running to process transitions
- API service running on localhost:8000
- Full stack via compose.e2e.yaml profile

E2E data seeded by init service:
- Test guild configuration (from DISCORD_GUILD_ID)
- Test channel configuration (from DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID)
- Test host user (from DISCORD_USER_ID)
