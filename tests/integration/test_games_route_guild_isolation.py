"""Integration tests for games database query patterns before guild_queries migration.

These tests establish behavioral baseline for GameService database operations.
Focus: Verify current database query behavior with minimal mocking.

IMPORTANT: Many tests document CURRENT INSECURE BEHAVIOR (no guild filtering in get_game).
After migration to guild_queries wrappers, tests must be updated to verify enforcement.
