# Changes: Waitlist Promotion DM on Leave

## Plan Reference

[Plan](../planning/plans/20260714-01-waitlist-promotion-notification-gap.plan.md)

---

## Phase 1: Extract shared waitlist transition detection

### Added

- `shared/services/waitlist_transitions.py` — New module holding `detect_and_notify_transitions(db, game, old_partitioned)`, extracted from `GameService`'s promotion/demotion notification logic. Partitions the current participant state, diffs against a previously captured `old_partitioned` state via `cleared_waitlist`/`entered_waitlist`, and enqueues `BotActionQueue(action_type="send_dm")` rows for `waitlist_promotion`/`waitlist_demotion` notifications. Returns `(promoted_discord_ids, demoted_discord_ids)`.
- `tests/unit/shared/services/test_waitlist_transitions.py` — New unit test suite (5 tests): promotion enqueues send_dm and returns promoted id, demotion enqueues send_dm and returns demoted id, no transitions enqueues nothing, promotion omits jump URL when `message_id` is missing, multiple simultaneous promotions enqueue one row per promoted user.

### Notes

- `GameService._detect_and_notify_transitions`/`_notify_promoted_users`/`_notify_demoted_users`/`_publish_promotion_notification` in `services/api/services/games.py` still contain the original (now duplicated) implementation — Phase 2 will delegate them to this new shared module and delete the dead private methods.

---

## Phase 2: Refactor `update_game` to use the shared transition function

### Modified

- `services/api/services/games.py` — `_detect_and_notify_transitions` body replaced with a single delegating call to `waitlist_transitions.detect_and_notify_transitions(self.db, game, old_partitioned)`; deleted the now-dead `_notify_promoted_users`, `_notify_demoted_users`, and `_publish_promotion_notification` methods; added `from shared.services import waitlist_transitions` import. No behavior change — `update_game`'s public contract is unchanged.
- `tests/unit/services/api/services/test_games_promotion.py` — `test_promotion_when_participant_removed` no longer patches the deleted `_notify_promoted_users` method; removed `test_detect_transitions_notifies_demoted_users` (duplicated coverage of the still-passing `test_detect_transitions_sends_demotion_dm`, which exercises the same path via real `BotActionQueue` assertions instead of mocking a now-deleted method).
- `tests/unit/services/api/services/test_games_service.py` — `test_detect_and_notify_promotions_with_promotions`/`test_detect_and_notify_promotions_no_promotions` rewritten to assert on real `mock_db.add` calls instead of patching the deleted `_notify_promoted_users` method; added `scheduled_at` to the test `GameSession` fixture since the notification path is now actually exercised.
- `tests/unit/api/services/test_games.py` — removed `TestNotifyDemotedUsers` (tested the now-deleted `_notify_demoted_users` method directly; equivalent coverage lives in `tests/unit/shared/services/test_waitlist_transitions.py`).

### Verified

- `uv run pytest tests/unit` — 2345 passed (net -2 vs. Phase 1's 2347: two tests removed for testing now-deleted private methods, no coverage lost)
- `uv run mypy shared/ services/` — no issues
- `scripts/run-integration-tests.sh tests/integration/test_player_removed_queue.py tests/integration/test_leave_game.py` — 9 passed, confirming `test_removing_confirmed_player_enqueues_waitlist_promotion_dm` still passes unmodified

---

## Phase 3: Create shared leave-game core

### Added

- `shared/services/leave_game.py` — New module holding `leave_game_and_notify(db, game, participant)`: captures `position_type`/`host_discord_id`/`old_partitioned` before delete, deletes the participant, flushes, refreshes `game.participants`, delegates promotion/demotion detection to `waitlist_transitions.detect_and_notify_transitions`, and (for a `HOST_ADDED` leaver with a host) enqueues a `host_added_dropout` `BotActionQueue` row — same DM fields as the current `services/api/services/games.py::leave_game` block. Depends only on `shared/` (no `services.api.*` import), so it's importable from both Docker images. Does not commit; caller commits.
- `tests/unit/shared/services/test_leave_game_shared.py` — New unit test suite (6 tests): deletes the passed participant, confirmed HOST_ADDED leave promotes a waitlisted HOST_ADDED user, HOST_ADDED leave enqueues a host_added_dropout DM to the host, SELF_ADDED leave with empty waitlist enqueues nothing, no dropout DM when `game.host` is `None`, freeing 1 slot promotes only the next-in-line of 2 waitlisted users. Named `test_leave_game_shared.py` (not `test_leave_game.py`) to avoid a pytest basename collision with the existing `tests/unit/services/bot/handlers/test_leave_game.py` (neither `tests/unit/shared/` nor `tests/unit/services/` has `__init__.py`, so pytest requires unique basenames).

### Verified

- `uv run pytest tests/unit/shared/services/test_leave_game_shared.py -v` — all 6 xfailed before implementation, all 6 passed after
- `uv run pytest tests/unit` — 2351 passed (net +6 vs. Phase 2's 2345)
- `uv run mypy shared/ services/` — no issues

---

## Phase 4: Wire the API leave path (bug fix)

### Added

- `tests/integration/test_leave_game_promotion.py` — New regression test `test_confirmed_leave_via_api_promotes_waitlisted_participant`: creates a `HOST_SELECTED_WITH_WAITLIST` game (`max_players=1`), inserts a confirmed + a waitlisted participant, has the confirmed participant call `POST /api/v1/games/{id}/leave` as themselves, and asserts a `waitlist_promotion` `send_dm` row targets the waitlisted user. Written `xfail(strict=True)` first, confirmed `xfailed` (proving the gap), then the marker removed after the fix landed.

### Modified

- `services/api/services/games.py` — `leave_game` now delegates the delete + promotion/demotion-detect-and-notify + host-added-dropout core to `leave_game_and_notify(self.db, game, participant)` instead of its previous inline `db.delete` + `HOST_ADDED` block; added `from shared.services.leave_game import leave_game_and_notify` import; removed the now-unused `DMFormats` import. This is the actual bug fix — `leave_game` now calls promotion detection, which it never did before.
- `tests/unit/api/services/test_games.py` — removed `TestLeaveGame::test_reload_failure_after_leave_raises_error`. That test asserted a `"Failed to reload game after leave"` `ValueError` raised when a second `self.get_game(game_id)` call returned `None`; that reload mechanism no longer exists — `leave_game_and_notify` reloads via `db.refresh(game, ["participants"])` per Task 3.3's design, not a second `get_game` call, so this failure path is now unreachable dead-code testing (same category as Phase 2's removed tests). The plan's Task 4.2 detail asserted this test would "still pass unmodified," which turned out to be inconsistent with Task 3.3's own already-implemented reload strategy.

### Verified

- `scripts/run-integration-tests.sh tests/integration/test_leave_game_promotion.py tests/integration/test_leave_game.py tests/integration/test_player_removed_queue.py tests/integration/test_games_crud.py` — 28 passed
- `uv run pytest tests/unit` — 2350 passed (net -1 vs. Phase 3's 2351: one obsolete test removed, see above)
- `uv run mypy shared/ services/` — no issues

### Notes

- The new integration test needed `seed_redis_cache(...)` for the _leaving_ participant (not just the bot-manager account already seeded by `_make_context`) — RLS (`get_db_with_user_guilds()`) resolves the acting user's guild membership from the Redis member-projection cache, and an unseeded user resolves to an empty guild list, making the game invisible ("Game not found" 404) even though it exists. That `seed_redis_cache` call must also come _before_ any `create_authenticated_client(...)` call in the test: that factory creates and closes its own asyncio event loop, and `seed_redis_cache`'s sync wrapper reuses `asyncio.get_event_loop()` — calling it afterward hits a closed loop (`RuntimeError: Event loop is closed`).

---

## Phase 5: Wire the bot leave path (bug fix + delivery unification)

### Added

- `tests/unit/bot/handlers/test_leave_game_handler.py` — New test `test_confirmed_leave_promotes_waitlisted_participant`: a confirmed `HOST_ADDED` leaver in a `HOST_SELECTED_WITH_WAITLIST`, `max_players=1` game promotes a waitlisted `HOST_ADDED` user; asserts a `waitlist_promotion` `BotActionQueue` row. Written `xfail(strict=True)` first (confirmed `xfailed` against the unfixed handler), then the marker removed. Also added `test_host_added_leave_dm_independent_of_gateway_cache` (renamed/rewritten from `test_host_added_leave_no_dm_when_host_not_in_cache`, whose old premise — a live `discord.Client.get_user()` gateway lookup suppressing the DM — no longer applies now that delivery is DB-driven via `game.host`).
- `tests/integration/test_leave_game.py` — New test `test_confirmed_leave_via_handler_promotes_waitlisted_participant`, mirroring the API-path regression test but calling `handle_leave_game(interaction, game_id)` directly against a real DB. Written `xfail(strict=True)` first, confirmed `xfailed`, then the marker removed.

### Modified

- `services/bot/handlers/leave_game.py` — `handle_leave_game` now delegates to `leave_game_and_notify(db, game, participant)` in place of the inline `db.delete(participant)` + `_notify_host_if_host_added(...)` call; deleted `_notify_host_if_host_added` entirely (its direct `discord.Client.send()` delivery is replaced by the shared function's `BotActionQueue` insert, unifying `host_added_dropout` delivery with the API-service path); `_validate_leave_game`'s query gained `selectinload(GameSession.participants).selectinload(GameParticipant.user)` so `game.participants` is populated before the delete, as `leave_game_and_notify`'s precondition requires; removed the now-unused `DMFormats`/`ParticipantType` imports, added `from shared.services.leave_game import leave_game_and_notify`.
- `tests/unit/bot/handlers/test_leave_game_handler.py` — `test_host_added_leave_sends_dm_to_host` and `test_non_host_added_leave_does_not_send_host_dm` rewritten to assert against `BotActionQueue` rows added to the mock DB session instead of a mocked `interaction.client.get_user(...).send(...)` call (delivery-mechanism change, not a regression — called out explicitly in the plan). `mock_game`/`mock_participant` fixtures and `_make_host_added_game`/`_make_host_added_participant`/`_make_host_added_mock_db` helpers gained `max_players`, `signup_method`, `position`, `joined_at`, and `participants` so `leave_game_and_notify`'s internal `partition_participants(...)` call has real, sortable values instead of unconfigured `MagicMock` attributes.
- `tests/integration/test_leave_game.py` — `test_host_added_leave_sends_dm_to_host` rewritten to query `bot_action_queue` for a `host_added_dropout` `send_dm` row instead of asserting a mocked `interaction.client.get_user(...).send(...)` call; `_insert_participant` gained optional `position`/`position_type`/`joined_at` parameters (defaults preserve existing call sites) so the new promotion test can control waitlist ordering.

### Verified

- `uv run pytest tests/unit/bot/handlers/test_leave_game_handler.py -v` — all 10 tests passing (confirmed the 2 new/rewritten tests `xfailed`/failed appropriately against the unfixed handler first, via a temporary `git stash` of the production fix, before reapplying it)
- `scripts/run-integration-tests.sh tests/integration/test_leave_game.py tests/integration/test_leave_game_promotion.py tests/integration/test_player_removed_queue.py tests/integration/test_button_handler.py tests/integration/test_join_game.py` — 22 passed
- `uv run pytest tests/unit` — 2351 passed
- `uv run mypy shared/ services/` — no issues
- `grep -n "_notify_host_if_host_added" services/bot/handlers/leave_game.py` — no matches

### Notes

- To properly follow the TDD bug-fix workflow despite having drafted the handler fix before the regression tests, the fix was temporarily `git stash`ed so the new `xfail`-marked tests could be run and confirmed `xfailed`/failing against the actual pre-fix handler, then the stash was popped and the `xfail` markers removed — same RED→GREEN discipline as if the fix had been written after the tests originally.

---

## Phase 6: E2E coverage for leave-triggers-promotion DM delivery

### Added

- `tests/e2e/test_waitlist_promotion.py` — New test `test_leave_promotes_waitlisted_participant_sends_dm`, combining `test_promotion_drag_delivers_promotion_dm`'s game-setup/DM-assertion style with `test_host_added_dropout_notification.py::test_host_added_dropout_sends_dm_to_host`'s leave-trigger pattern: creates a `max_players=1` game with Player A confirmed and the real test user (`discord_user_id`) waitlisted, has Player A call `POST /api/v1/games/{id}/leave` via `authenticated_player_a_client`, and verifies the waitlisted test user receives a real `waitlist_promotion` DM via `main_bot_helper.wait_for_recent_dm(dm_type=DMType.PROMOTION, ...)`, including jump-URL content. No `xfail` cycle — e2e coverage added after the implementation exists, per TDD instructions for e2e tests.

### Verified

- `scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh tests/e2e/test_waitlist_promotion.py::test_leave_promotes_waitlisted_participant_sends_dm` — 1 passed
- `scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh tests/e2e/test_waitlist_promotion.py tests/e2e/test_host_added_dropout_notification.py` — 5 passed, no regression to the existing promotion/dropout e2e tests
- `uv run pytest tests/unit` — 2351 passed
- `uv run mypy shared/ services/` — no issues

### Notes

- Per the research's e2e-feasibility analysis, this covers only the API leave path (`POST /{game_id}/leave`). The bot-service Discord-button path (`handle_leave_game`) has no e2e equivalent and cannot get one on this platform: a component-interaction (button click) can only originate from a real Discord client UI session, not a bot token, so it stays covered at the integration level (Phase 5's `tests/integration/test_leave_game.py`).
