# Release Changes: Discord Channel Links in Game Location Field

**Related Plan**: 20260210-01-channel-links-in-game-location-plan.instructions.md
**Implementation Date**: 2026-02-10

## Summary

Enable users to reference Discord channels in game location field using `#channel-name` format, with backend validation that converts mentions to clickable Discord channel links (`<#channel_id>`) in game announcements.

## Changes

### Added

- services/api/services/channel_resolver.py - Created ChannelResolver service stub with resolve_channel_mentions method raising NotImplementedError
- tests/services/api/services/test_channel_resolver.py - Created comprehensive unit tests testing actual desired behavior (7 test cases: single match returns `<#id>` format, disambiguation returns errors with suggestions, not found returns errors with suggestions, special characters work, mixed content resolves, empty text handled, plain text unchanged) - Tests properly fail with NotImplementedError (TDD RED phase)

### Modified

- services/api/services/channel_resolver.py - Implemented resolve_channel_mentions with regex pattern r'#([\w-]+)', Discord API channel lookup, single match conversion to <#id>, multiple match disambiguation errors, not found errors with fuzzy suggestions (TDD GREEN phase - all tests passing). Fixed line length formatting (E501).
- tests/services/api/services/test_channel_resolver.py - Added 8 edge case tests: multiple mentions in one location, channel at text start/end, adjacent mentions, empty guild channel list, filtering non-text channels, case-insensitive matching, mixed valid/invalid channels. Total 15 tests, 100% code coverage.
- services/api/services/games.py - Added ChannelResolver import and parameter to GameService.**init**, added channel_resolver field initialization, integrated channel mention resolution in create_game method (after resolving template fields, before participant resolution) with ValidationError raised for invalid channel mentions
- services/api/routes/games.py - Added channel_resolver_module import, instantiated ChannelResolver in get_game_service dependency and passed to GameService
- tests/services/api/services/conftest.py - Added channel_resolver_module import, created mock_channel_resolver fixture (AsyncMock of ChannelResolver), updated game_service fixture to include mock_channel_resolver parameter
- tests/integration/test_games_route_guild_isolation.py - Updated 6 GameService instantiations to include channel_resolver=MagicMock() parameter
- tests/integration/services/api/services/test_game_image_integration.py - Updated 6 GameService instantiations to include channel_resolver=MagicMock() parameter
- tests/services/api/services/test_games.py - Added 4 integration tests for channel resolution: test_create_game_with_valid_channel_mention (verifies <#id> format in database), test_create_game_with_invalid_channel_raises_validation_error (verifies ValidationError with suggestions), test_create_game_with_ambiguous_channel_raises_validation_error (verifies disambiguation error), test_create_game_with_plain_text_location_unchanged (verifies backward compatibility). Updated test_create_game_with_where_field to include mock_channel_resolver parameter and setup.

**Note on Task 2.3**: No code changes needed. ValidationError from ChannelResolver is already handled by existing \_handle_game_operation_errors function in services/api/routes/games.py (returns HTTP 422 with invalid_mentions field). Existing tests verify error propagation works correctly.

### Removed
