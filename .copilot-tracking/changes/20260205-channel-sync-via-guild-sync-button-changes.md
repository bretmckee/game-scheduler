# Release Changes: Channel Sync via Guild Sync Button

**Related Plan**: 20260205-channel-sync-via-guild-sync-button.plan.md
**Implementation Date**: 2026-02-05

## Summary

Extend existing guild sync operation to refresh channel lists for existing guilds, marking new channels as active and deleted channels as inactive.

## Changes

### Added

### Modified

- services/api/database/queries.py - Updated `get_channels_by_guild()` to filter by is_active=True, returning only active channels for channel selection dropdowns (CORRECTED IN PHASE 6: was documented as complete but not actually implemented)
- services/api/services/guild_service.py - Added `_sync_guild_channels()` helper function to sync channels from Discord to database (get-or-create pattern with is_active flag, relies on ORM change tracking)
- services/api/services/guild_service.py - Updated `sync_user_guilds()` to process existing guilds and sync their channels, returning updated_channels count in addition to new_guilds and new_channels
- tests/services/api/services/test_guild_service.py - Added comprehensive unit tests for `_sync_guild_channels()` covering all scenarios (new channels, reactivation, deactivation, no changes)
- tests/services/api/services/test_guild_service.py - Added unit tests for updated `sync_user_guilds()` covering existing guild sync, new guild creation, and mixed scenarios
- shared/schemas/guild.py - Added `updated_channels` field to GuildSyncResponse schema to track channels synced for existing guilds
- services/api/routes/guilds.py - Updated `sync_guilds()` endpoint to return `updated_channels` in response and updated docstring to reflect channel sync functionality
- services/api/routes/guilds.py - Updated `list_guild_channels()` endpoint to filter channels by is_active=True, hiding deleted Discord channels from dropdowns (docstring updated to reflect active-only filtering)
- frontend/src/api/guilds.ts - Added `updated_channels` field to GuildSyncResponse interface to match backend schema
- frontend/src/pages/GuildListPage.tsx - Updated sync button labels from "Refresh Servers" to "Sync Servers and Channels" to reflect that both guilds and channels are synced
- frontend/src/pages/GuildListPage.tsx - Updated sync success message to display counts for new guilds, new channels, and updated channels with proper pluralization
- tests/integration/test_guild_sync_channel_operations.py - NEW comprehensive integration test suite with 8 tests covering all channel sync scenarios (new guilds, existing guilds, channel additions, deletions, reactivations, filtering, foreign key integrity, no-change scenarios)

### Removed

### Testing

#### Unit Tests

- tests/services/api/services/test_guild_service.py - Added 7 unit tests for `_sync_guild_channels()` and `sync_user_guilds()` covering all edge cases
- All unit tests passing ✅

#### Integration Tests

- tests/integration/test_guild_sync_channel_operations.py - 8 integration tests against real PostgreSQL database
- Tests verify: new channel creation, marking inactive, reactivation, filtering, foreign key integrity, accurate counts, and no-change scenarios
- All integration tests passing ✅
- Discord client properly mocked (no real API calls in tests)

#### Manual Validation Required

- Create game with specific channel, delete channel from Discord, sync guilds, verify channel marked inactive but game still references it
- Verify inactive channels don't appear in dropdowns for new templates/games
