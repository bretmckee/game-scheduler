### Rejected Rules

- **RUF029 (unnecessary async functions)** - Rejected after evaluation in Task 4.3
  - Reason: 100% false positive rate (10/10 violations were architecturally required)
  - FastAPI dependency pattern requires async functions even without await
  - FastAPI exception handlers must be async per framework requirements
  - discord.py extension setup functions must be async per convention
  - Functions awaited in async contexts must be async regardless of internal await usage
  - Rule provides no value in FastAPI/discord.py codebases where async is part of framework contracts

### Deferred

- **RUF100 (unused noqa removal)** - Originally part of Task 4.1, deferred to Phase 7 Task 7.3
  - Reason: RUF100 has 100% false positive rate during incremental rule adoption
  - Reports all noqa comments as "non-enabled" when checking in isolation
  - Would remove 59 legitimate noqa comments (S404, S603, PLW0603, PLC0415, B008, PLC2701, S104)
  - Requires full rule context to work correctly
  - Will be manually reviewed in Phase 7 after all rules are enabled

**Task 4.4: Enable polish and cleanup rules in configuration**

- services/api/middleware/error_handler.py - Converted loop to list comprehension for better performance (PERF401)
- services/api/middleware/error_handler.py - Removed exc_info parameter outside exception handlers (LOG014) in two locations
- services/bot/bot.py - Replaced logger.exception with logger.error for LOG004 compliance in on_error method
- tests/services/bot/test_bot.py - Updated test assertion to expect logger.error instead of logger.exception
- pyproject.toml - Added PERF, G, LOG, RUF to select list
- pyproject.toml - Added RUF029 (unnecessary async) and RUF100 (unused noqa) to ignore list with comments explaining exclusions

## Phase 5: Type Annotations (Complete)

**Task 5.1: Add comprehensive type annotations (72 violations)**

Applied comprehensive type annotations throughout the codebase, fixing all ANN violations. Used strategic `noqa:ANN401` comments where `Any` type is intentionally required for framework compatibility.

### Phase 5 Approach

1. Auto-fixed 27 ANN204 violations (missing __init__ return types) with `ruff check --select ANN204 --fix --unsafe-fixes`
2. Manually fixed 45 remaining violations:
   - Added return type annotations to public and private functions
   - Added parameter type annotations to function arguments
   - Used `Any` with `noqa:ANN401` for framework-controlled parameters (FastAPI, discord.py, pika, psycopg2)
   - Fixed import issues (missing Any, AsyncIterator, Callable, Awaitable)
   - Resolved variable naming conflicts (discord_client parameter vs module alias)

## Phase 6: Unused Code Cleanup (Complete)

**Task 6.1: Review and fix unused function arguments (27 violations)**

Fixed all 27 ARG violations by prefixing unused parameters with underscore to indicate they are intentionally unused, following Python conventions for framework-required signatures:

**Task 6.2: Enable ARG rules in configuration**

- pyproject.toml - Added ARG (flake8-unused-arguments) to select list
- pyproject.toml - Added ARG001, ARG002, ARG004, ARG005 to per-file-ignores for tests (unused arguments common in test fixtures, mocks, and helpers)
- tests/services/bot/events/test_handlers.py - Updated 3 test calls to _send_reminder_dm to use renamed _reminder_minutes parameter
- services/bot/formatters/game_message.py - Updated format_game_announcement to pass _signup_instructions instead of signup_instructions
- Verified zero violations: `ruff check --select ARG` returns clean
## Phase 7: Final Integration (In Progress)

**Task 7.1: Update pre-commit hooks and CI/CD (Complete)**

Verified that pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline properly use expanded Ruff rule set from pyproject.toml:

- .pre-commit-config.yaml - Verified ruff-check hook uses `uv run ruff check --fix` which automatically applies all rules from pyproject.toml
- .pre-commit-config.yaml - Verified ruff-format hook uses `uv run ruff format` for consistent code formatting
- .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml - Verified CI lint job runs `uv run ruff check .` which enforces all enabled rules
- .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml - Verified CI lint job runs `uv run ruff format --check .` to ensure formatting compliance
- Verified zero violations: `ruff check --exclude tests` returns clean across all production code
- Verified all unit tests pass: 1391 tests passed in test suite

**Configuration Status**:
- Pre-commit hooks: ✅ Configured to use full pyproject.toml rule set with auto-fix
- CI/CD Pipeline: ✅ Configured to enforce full pyproject.toml rule set
- Developer workflow: ✅ No changes needed - existing hooks already optimal
- Production code: ✅ Zero violations across all enabled rules (S, ASYNC, FAST, RET, SIM, TC, PLE, PLW, PLC, T20, ERA, A, DTZ, ICN, PT, G, EM, PERF, LOG, RUF, ARG)
**Task 7.2: Fix ANN101/ANN102 deprecated warnings (Complete)**

- pyproject.toml - Removed ANN101 and ANN102 from ignore list as these rules have been removed from Ruff
- Verified warning messages: "The following rules have been removed and ignoring them has no effect: ANN101, ANN102"
- No code changes needed - rules no longer exist in Ruff

**Task 7.3: Clean up unused noqa directives (Complete)**

Removed 3 unused noqa directives that became unnecessary after converting to Annotated pattern in Phase 1:

- services/api/routes/export.py - Removed 3 unnecessary `# noqa: B008` comments on Annotated dependency parameters (user, db, role_service)
- Verified zero violations: `ruff check --exclude tests` returns "All checks passed!"
- All unit tests pass: 1391 tests passed confirming no regressions

**Status**: Phase 7 complete - All cleanup tasks finished, RUF100 enabled in pyproject.toml via RUF category
