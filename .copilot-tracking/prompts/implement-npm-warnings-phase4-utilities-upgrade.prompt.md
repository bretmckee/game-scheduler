# Implementation Prompt: NPM Warnings Elimination Phase 4 - Routing & Utilities Upgrade

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Changes Tracking File

You WILL create `20251214-npm-warnings-phase4-utilities-upgrade-changes.md` in #file:../changes/ if it does not exist.

### Step 2: Execute Implementation

You WILL follow #file:../../.github/instructions/task-implementation.instructions.md
You WILL systematically implement #file:../plans/20251214-npm-warnings-phase4-utilities-upgrade-plan.instructions.md task-by-task
You WILL follow ALL project standards and conventions:

- #file:../../.github/instructions/typescript-5-es2022.instructions.md for TypeScript
- #file:../../.github/instructions/reactjs.instructions.md for React
- #file:../../.github/instructions/coding-best-practices.instructions.md for general practices

**CRITICAL**: This phase requires assessment and decisions. You WILL stop after Phase 1 and Phase 2 for user review.

1. Provide summary of changes
2. Provide links to planning documents
3. **MANDATORY**: Delete this prompt file
