# Implementation Prompt: NPM Warnings Elimination Phase 3 - MUI Framework Upgrade

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Changes Tracking File

You WILL create `20251214-npm-warnings-phase3-mui-upgrade-changes.md` in #file:../changes/ if it does not exist.

### Step 2: Execute Implementation

You WILL follow #file:../../.github/instructions/task-implementation.instructions.md
You WILL systematically implement #file:../plans/20251214-npm-warnings-phase3-mui-upgrade-plan.instructions.md task-by-task
You WILL follow ALL project standards and conventions:

- #file:../../.github/instructions/typescript-5-es2022.instructions.md for all TypeScript code
- #file:../../.github/instructions/reactjs.instructions.md for all React code
- #file:../../.github/instructions/self-explanatory-code-commenting.instructions.md for commenting style
- #file:../../.github/instructions/taming-copilot.instructions.md for interaction patterns
- #file:../../.github/instructions/coding-best-practices.instructions.md for general practices

**CRITICAL**: This phase requires a go/no-go decision in Task 1.3. You WILL stop after Phase 1 for user review of the decision.

### Step 3: Cleanup

When ALL Phases are checked off (`[x]`) and completed you WILL do the following:

1. You WILL provide a markdown style link and a summary of all changes from #file:../changes/20251214-npm-warnings-phase3-mui-upgrade-changes.md to the user

2. You WILL provide markdown style links to planning documents and recommend cleanup
3. **MANDATORY**: You WILL attempt to delete this prompt file

- [ ] Changes tracking file created
- [ ] Impact assessment completed
- [ ] Go/no-go decision made and documented
