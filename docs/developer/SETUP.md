# Development Setup

This guide covers setting up a complete development environment for Game Scheduler, including quick start, development workflow, code quality tools, and local testing.

## Development Container (Recommended)

The project includes a VS Code Dev Container with all tools pre-installed. This is the **recommended** development approach as it provides:

- **Pre-installed tools**: Python 3.13, uv, Node.js 24, Docker CLI, Git
- **Pre-configured**: All Python and frontend dependencies installed
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automatically installed and ready to use
- **Consistent environment**: Same setup for all developers
- **VS Code integration**: Debugging, linting, and formatting configured

### Using the Dev Container

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed
   - Visual Studio Code with "Dev Containers" extension

2. **Open in container**:
   ```bash
   # Clone and open in VS Code
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd game-scheduler
   code .
   # VS Code will prompt to "Reopen in Container" - click it
   # Or use Command Palette: "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
   ```

3. **Automatic setup**:
   - Container builds with all dependencies
   - Pre-commit hooks installed automatically
   - Frontend dependencies installed
   - Ready to develop immediately!

4. **Start infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   # Inside dev container terminal
   docker compose up postgres redis rabbitmq -d
   ```

5. **Run services** (choose one):
   ```bash
   # Option A: Run in containers
   docker compose up api bot notification-daemon status-transition-daemon -d

   # Option B: Run locally in dev container for debugging
   cd services/api && uvicorn main:app --reload
   cd services/bot && python -m bot.main
   cd services/scheduler && python -m notification_daemon_wrapper
   ```

### Dev Container Features

The dev container includes:
- Python 3.13 with all project dependencies (including dev group)
- Node.js 24 with frontend dependencies
- Docker CLI for managing containers
- Git with SSH support
- `act` for local GitHub Actions testing
- Pre-commit hooks configured and installed
- VS Code extensions: Python, Pylance, Ruff, ESLint, Prettier

**All pre-commit hooks work immediately** - no need to run `uv sync` or `npm install` manually!

## Local Development (Without Container)

If you prefer to develop outside the container:

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git installed
- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 18+
- `uv` for Python tooling: `pip install uv`

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd game-scheduler
```

2. **Verify development environment configuration**:

```bash
# Check that .env symlink points to development config
ls -la .env
# Should show: .env -> config/env/env.dev
```

The `.env` symlink is pre-configured to point to `config/env/env.dev`, which contains:
- `COMPOSE_FILE=compose.yaml:compose.override.yaml` - Loads development compose files
- Development-specific configuration (DEBUG logging, all ports exposed)

3. **Update Discord bot credentials** (if needed):

Edit `config/env/env.dev` and add your Discord bot token:

```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

See [Deployment Guide](../deployment/README.md) for instructions on creating a Discord bot application and obtaining credentials.

4. **Start all services**:

```bash
docker compose up
```

That's it! The development environment will:
- Mount your source code as volumes (no rebuilds needed for code changes)
- Enable hot-reload for instant feedback
- Expose all service ports including management UIs
- Use development stages from Dockerfiles

## Development Environment

### How It Works

The development environment uses Docker Compose with volume mounts for instant code changes:

- **Python services** (API, bot, daemons): Source files mounted from `services/` and `shared/`
  - API uses `uvicorn --reload` for auto-restart on changes
  - Bot and daemons use `python -m` with watch mode

- **Frontend**: Source files mounted from `frontend/src/`
  - Vite dev server with hot module replacement (HMR)
  - Changes appear instantly in browser at http://localhost:3000

- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, Grafana Alloy
  - Persistent data volumes for database and message broker
  - Management UIs exposed for debugging

### File Permissions

Source files must be **world-readable** for volume mounts to work in containers:

```bash
# If you encounter permission errors
chmod -R o+r shared/ services/ frontend/
```

Development containers run as non-root user (UID 1000) for security.

### Accessing Services

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs (Swagger)**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **RabbitMQ Management**: http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin)

### Monitoring Logs

```bash
# View all logs
docker compose logs -f

# View specific service logs
docker compose logs -f api
docker compose logs -f bot
docker compose logs -f notification-daemon
docker compose logs -f status-transition-daemon

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart api
```

## Development Workflow

### Making Code Changes

1. **Edit files** in `shared/`, `services/`, or `frontend/src/`
2. **Changes appear instantly** in running containers (no rebuild required)
3. **Python services** auto-reload when files change
4. **Frontend** updates immediately with hot module replacement

### When Rebuilds Are Needed

Rebuild only when you change:

- **Dependencies**: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`
- **Dockerfiles**: Any modifications to build steps
- **New files**: That need to be included in container image

```bash
# Rebuild specific service
docker compose build api

# Rebuild all services
docker compose build

# Force clean rebuild (no cache)
docker compose build --no-cache
```

### Running Specific Services

Start infrastructure and individual services as needed:

```bash
# Start infrastructure only
docker compose up -d postgres rabbitmq redis

# Run database migrations
docker compose run --rm api alembic upgrade head

# Start API service only
docker compose up -d api

# Start Discord bot only
docker compose up -d bot

# Start notification daemon only
docker compose up -d notification-daemon

# Start status transition daemon only
docker compose up -d status-transition-daemon
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks to automatically validate code quality before commits. These hooks are **essential for maintaining project standards**, especially when working with AI-assisted development tools. While AI can generate code quickly, it may not always follow project-specific conventions, complexity limits, or security requirements - even when explicitly instructed. The pre-commit hooks provide automated verification that all code (human or AI-generated) meets the project's quality standards before it enters the repository.

**Key principle**: Trust, but verify. Let AI help you code faster, but rely on automated checks to ensure quality.

### Dev Container Users (Everything Pre-Installed)

If you're using the dev container, **all hooks work immediately** - no additional setup needed! The container includes:
- All Python dependencies installed system-wide
- All frontend dependencies installed in `frontend/node_modules`
- Pre-commit hooks automatically installed on container creation

Just commit normally:
```bash
git add modified_file.py
git commit -m "Your changes"
# All hooks run automatically with full functionality
```

### Local Development Users

Most hooks use **standalone isolated environments** that work immediately without dependencies. Some hooks require full project setup.

#### Quick Start (Works Immediately)

Standalone hooks work right away:

```bash
# Install hooks (one-time setup)
uv tool run pre-commit install

# Run standalone hooks - no dependencies needed!
pre-commit run ruff --all-files      # Python linting (isolated)
pre-commit run prettier --all-files  # Frontend formatting (isolated)
pre-commit run eslint --all-files    # Frontend linting (isolated)
pre-commit run typescript --all-files # TypeScript checking (isolated)
```

#### Standalone Hooks

These hooks work without project dependencies:

- **File cleanup**: Trailing whitespace, end-of-file fixer, line endings
- **Python linting/formatting**: `ruff` (uses official astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit)
- **Frontend formatting**: `prettier` (isolated node environment)
- **Frontend linting**: `eslint` (isolated with TypeScript/React plugins)
- **TypeScript checking**: `typescript` (isolated node environment)
- **Code complexity**: `complexipy`, `lizard` (isolated environments)
- **Duplicate detection**: `jscpd` (isolated node environment)
- **Copyright headers**: `autocopyright` (isolated Python environment)

#### Full Project Setup (For Test Hooks)

Some hooks require the full project environment:

```bash
# Install Python project dependencies (required for Python tests)
uv sync

# Install frontend dependencies (required for frontend tests)
cd frontend && npm install
```

#### System-Dependent Hooks

These require project setup:

| Hook | Requires | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `mypy` | `uv sync` | Python type checking with project dependencies |
| `python-compile` | `uv sync` | Python compilation validation |
| `pytest-coverage` | `uv sync` | Python unit tests with coverage |
| `diff-coverage` | `uv sync` | Python diff coverage check |
| `frontend-build` | `cd frontend && npm install` | Frontend build validation |
| `vitest-coverage` | `cd frontend && npm install` | Frontend unit tests with coverage |
| `diff-coverage-frontend` | `cd frontend && npm install` | Frontend diff coverage check |
| `ci-cd-workflow` (manual) | Docker | Run GitHub Actions locally with `act` |

### Normal Usage

```bash
# Just commit normally - all hooks run automatically
git add modified_file.py
git commit -m "Your commit message"
# Pre-commit runs all checks + tests for modified files automatically
# Commit succeeds if all checks pass, fails otherwise
```

What runs automatically on every commit:
- All standalone hooks (linting, formatting, type checking, complexity)
- System-dependent hooks (tests for new/modified files only)
  - **Dev container**: All system hooks work (dependencies pre-installed)
  - **Local dev**: Only works after `uv sync` and `npm install`

### Manual Test Execution

```bash
# Run ALL unit tests (comprehensive validation)
pre-commit run pytest-all --hook-stage manual

# Run ALL frontend tests
pre-commit run vitest-all --hook-stage manual

# Run CI/CD workflow locally (same as GitHub Actions, requires Docker)
pre-commit run ci-cd-workflow --hook-stage manual

# Run all hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Emergency Skip (Use Sparingly)

```bash
# Skip ALL hooks for urgent commits
git commit -m "WIP: urgent hotfix" --no-verify

# Skip specific hooks
SKIP=pytest-changed git commit -m "Skip tests temporarily"
```

**Note:** Skipping hooks locally doesn't skip CI/CD checks. All validations still run in the GitHub Actions pipeline.

### Architecture Notes

- **Official repositories**: Ruff uses `github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit` for automatic updates
- **Isolated environments**: Most tools use `language: python` or `language: node` with `additional_dependencies`
- **Cached environments**: Pre-commit caches isolated environments in `~/.cache/pre-commit/`
- **System hooks**: Complex tools requiring full project context use `language: system`

**Performance expectations:**
- Most commits: 15-45 seconds (depending on files changed)
- Tests run ONLY on new/modified files for efficiency
- Full test suite still runs in CI/CD for comprehensive validation

## Code Quality Standards

The project enforces comprehensive code quality standards through automated linting and testing.

### Python Linting (Ruff)

Ruff enforces 33 rule categories covering security, correctness, performance, and style:

**Security & Correctness:**
- **S** (flake8-bandit): Security vulnerability detection (SQL injection, subprocess security, hardcoded secrets)
- **ASYNC** (flake8-async): Async/await best practices
- **FAST** (FastAPI): FastAPI-specific patterns (Annotated dependencies)

**Code Quality & Maintainability:**
- **E/W** (pycodestyle): PEP 8 style enforcement
- **F** (Pyflakes): Logical errors and undefined names
- **N** (pep8-naming): Naming convention enforcement
- **B** (flake8-bugbear): Common bug patterns
- **C4** (flake8-comprehensions): List/dict comprehension improvements
- **UP** (pyupgrade): Modern Python 3.13+ syntax
- **RET** (flake8-return): Return statement optimization
- **SIM** (flake8-simplify): Code simplification opportunities
- **TC** (flake8-type-checking): TYPE_CHECKING import optimization
- **PLE/PLW/PLC** (Pylint): Pylint error/warning/convention checks
- **ERA** (eradicate): Commented-out code detection
- **A** (flake8-builtins): Builtin shadowing prevention
- **DTZ** (flake8-datetimez): Timezone-aware datetime usage
- **ICN** (flake8-import-conventions): Import convention enforcement
- **PT** (flake8-pytest-style): Pytest best practices

**Performance:**
- **PERF** (Perflint): Performance anti-patterns
- **G004** (flake8-logging-format): Lazy logging (no f-strings in logging)

**Polish & Documentation:**
- **T20** (flake8-print): No print statements in production code (use logging)
- **EM** (flake8-errmsg): Exception message extraction
- **G/LOG** (flake8-logging-format): Logging best practices
- **ANN** (flake8-annotations): Comprehensive type annotations
- **ARG** (flake8-unused-arguments): Unused argument detection
- **RUF** (Ruff-specific): Ruff's own code quality rules

### Code Complexity Limits

- **Cyclomatic complexity**: Max 10 per function (C901)
- **Statement count**: Max 50 per function (PLR0915)
- **Overall complexity**: Max 15 (complexipy)

### Running Linting Locally

```bash
# Check all Python files (uses pyproject.toml configuration)
uv run ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues where possible
uv run ruff check --fix .

# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Check specific rule category
uv run ruff check --select S,ASYNC,FAST .
```

**Note:** All linting rules are enforced in CI/CD and pre-commit hooks. The project maintains a zero-violation baseline for all enabled rules.

### Frontend Linting

- **ESLint**: TypeScript and React best practices
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking

```bash
cd frontend

# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format with Prettier
npm run format

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing at multiple levels:

- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated component tests
- **Integration Tests**: Service integration with database/message broker
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full system tests with Discord bot interactions

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing documentation.

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Run Python unit tests
pre-commit run pytest-all --hook-stage manual

# Run frontend unit tests
pre-commit run vitest-all --hook-stage manual

# Run integration tests
scripts/run-integration-tests.sh

# Run E2E tests
scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh

# Run with coverage
scripts/coverage-report.sh
```

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Files

Configuration is managed through environment files in `config/env/`:

- **`config/env/env.dev`**: Development (volume mounts, DEBUG logging, all ports exposed)
- **`config/env/env.prod`**: Production (production builds, INFO logging, no port mappings)
- **`config/env/env.staging`**: Staging (production builds with DEBUG logging, app ports exposed)
- **`config/env/env.int`**: Integration tests
- **`config/env/env.e2e`**: End-to-end tests

Each environment file contains a `COMPOSE_FILE` variable specifying which compose files to merge.

### Switching Environments

```bash
# Use production configuration
docker compose --env-file config/env/env.prod up

# Use staging configuration
docker compose --env-file config/env/env.staging up

# Development uses .env symlink automatically (no --env-file needed)
docker compose up
```

### Docker Compose Files

- **`compose.yaml`**: Production-ready base configuration
- **`compose.override.yaml`**: Development overrides (auto-loaded via .env symlink)
- **`compose.prod.yaml`**: Production overrides (minimal)
- **`compose.staging.yaml`**: Staging overrides (DEBUG logging, app ports)
- **`compose.int.yaml`**: Integration test overrides
- **`compose.e2e.yaml`**: E2E test overrides

## Building for Production

### Production Builds

For production deployments, use the production environment file:

```bash
# Build production images
docker compose --env-file config/env/env.prod build

# Start production services
docker compose --env-file config/env/env.prod up -d
```

Production builds:
- Target `production` stage in Dockerfiles
- Copy all source code into images (no volume mounts)
- Use optimized production commands
- Include restart policies for reliability

### Multi-Architecture Builds

The project supports building images for both ARM64 (Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton) and AMD64 (traditional x86) architectures using Docker Bake.

#### Setup

Create a multi-platform builder (one-time setup):

```bash
# Check existing builders
docker buildx ls

# Create and use multi-platform builder
docker buildx create --use
```

#### Building and Pushing Images

Build for multiple architectures and push to registry:

```bash
# Build all services for both architectures and push
docker buildx bake --push

# Build specific service(s)
docker buildx bake --push api bot

# Build with custom registry and tag
IMAGE_REGISTRY=myregistry.com/ IMAGE_TAG=v1.2.3 docker buildx bake --push

# Build without registry prefix (empty string)
IMAGE_REGISTRY= IMAGE_TAG=dev docker buildx bake --push
```

#### Environment Variables

Configure in `.env` file:

- `IMAGE_REGISTRY`: Docker registry URL prefix (include trailing slash)
  - Default: `172-16-1-24.xip.boneheads.us:5050/`
  - Examples: `docker.io/myorg/`, empty for local
- `IMAGE_TAG`: Image tag for built containers
  - Default: `latest`
  - Examples: `v1.0.0`, `dev`, `staging`

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Errors

If you see permission errors when running containers:

```bash
# Make source files world-readable
chmod -R o+r shared/ services/ frontend/
```

### Port Conflicts

If ports are already in use:

1. Check what's using the port: `lsof -i :3000`
2. Stop conflicting services
3. Or modify port mappings in `compose.override.yaml`

### Container Won't Start

Check logs for errors:

```bash
docker compose logs <service-name>
```

Common issues:
- Missing environment variables (check `config/env/env.dev`)
- Database not ready (wait for postgres container to be healthy)
- Dependency changes (rebuild container)

### Database Migrations

If database schema is out of date:

```bash
# Run migrations
docker compose run --rm api alembic upgrade head

# Create new migration (after model changes)
docker compose run --rm api alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
```

### Clear Development Data

Reset database and caches:

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Remove volumes (WARNING: deletes all data)
docker compose down -v

# Restart fresh
docker compose up
```

## Next Steps

- Review [architecture.md](architecture.md) for system design
- Read [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for testing strategies
- See [database.md](database.md) for database schema
- Check [oauth-flow.md](oauth-flow.md) for authentication
- Review [transaction-management.md](transaction-management.md) for service patterns
